# AirportCodes

Welcome to the AirportCodes CLI. 

This is a command line interface that converts a city into a three letter IATA airport code.

An IATA airport code converts a city into a three-letter code to identify a particular airport in that city for use with documents relating to passenger reservations and ticketing as well as flight timetables, luggage tags, air traffic control, and other standard industry procedures. Knowing your specific airport code makes searches more efficient and accurate. Travel agents use code converters in their global distribution systems. 

For more information about IATA airport codes please see the following Wiki:
